# Databases-Notebooks

This is the repository of jupyter notebooks working with databases and python. 
This repository includes notebooks working with SQL and MongoDB as databases and python language was used to make connections between databases and notebooks. 
These notebooks represent basic and some advanced operations for establishing connections between notebooks and databases. 
After establishing a connection, tables were created using SQL queries. 
After table creation, data was stored in the tables using SQL queries. 
In the case of MongoDB, collections were made for data storage. 
The code is written in a rough way because these notebooks are for practice purposes, not for real-time problem statements.
